			<string>&lt;p&gt;PeerTalk is a iOS and OS X Cocoa library for communicating over USB and TCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides you with USB device attach/detach events and attached device&amp;#39;s info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can connect to TCP services on supported attached devices (e.g. an iPhone), bridging the communication over USB transport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offers a higher-level API (PTChannel and PTProtocol) for convenient implementations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tested and designed for libdispatch (aka Grand Central Dispatch).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
