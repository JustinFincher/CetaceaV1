# Cetacea V1

**Project Abandoned**, due to difficulties regex handling large scale text, too ambitious sync & storage structure, and no intention to fix it (would rather rewrite V2 from ground up). 

Mainly I deprecate this project because it's a too long development cycle with many other things going on and I couldn't even remember meanings of my own code when I revisit it, also the whole structure looks shitty now ~~and I am lazy so why don't make it deprecated, so that's problem solved.~~
